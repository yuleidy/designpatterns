# designpatterns
My PHP implementation of some design patterns.

I took the ideas and concepts of these patterns from this amazing course in PluralSight:
Design Patterns Library
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/patterns-library/table-of-contents

In this project you'll find my implementation of some of those patterns in PHP.
These are the ones I have included so far, and I have them organized using the patterns classification, like this:

- Behavioral Patterns:
  1. Chain of Responsibility 
  2. Observer
  3. Strategy
  
- Creational Patterns:
  1. Builder
  2. Factory Method
  3. Singleton
  
- Structural Patterns:
  1. Adapter
  2. Bridge
  3. Decorator

Some notes about what design patterns are and aren't:
1. Design Pattern is a blueprint, NOT an Algorithm and NOT code.
2. A design pattern is a general and reusable solution to a common and recurring problem.
3. Design Pattern is not a defined or finished solution to a problem, but a template or recipe to solve certain types of problems.
4. A design pattern is an abstraction on top of code.
5. Degsign Patterns deal with problems already solved.

Patterns Classification:
-Creational
-Structural
-Behavioral
-Security
-Concurrency
-SQL
-User Interface
-Relational
-Social 
-Distributed
